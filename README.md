# discord-markov
This program utilizes markopvify to make new sentences based on discord users.


# Information
Currently undergoing a rewrite. It also requires a lot of bodging to set up and make work with any given server. 


## Installation
Requires discord.py and markovify.

```
pip install discord
pip install markovify
```

I used DiscordCharExporter.CLI to get and store chats. Store it in the parent foler of this package if you want to use the included chat downloaders , i.e. the executable is at path `\\discord-markov\\DiscordChatExporter.CLI\\DiscordChatExporter.CLI`.
